Colemak keyboard layout
=======================

Colemak is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts. It is designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.

Caps Lock remapping
-------------------

This installer will remap Caps Lock to Backspace as originally designed by Shai Coleman.

Installing to CO locale
-----------------------

By default the layout will be installed to locale English(US), variant Colemak. Some people prefer to abuse Corsican locale because the appriviation fits nicely and it is easier to switch between locales than variants. If you want install to Corsican locale, use package parameter "locale=co" e.g.

    choco install colemak -params locale=co
